## 🚀 Learning Journey
Here’s what I’ve practiced and uploaded so far:

### 📂 Clauses
- Practiced queries on **WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY, DISTINCT, BETWEEN, IN, LIKE** etc.

  - Find orders in the last 7 days
  - Orders between two dates
  - First purchase of each customer

### 📂 Functions
- Practiced **Aggregate functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG, MIN, MAX)**, **String functions**, and **Date functions**.
- **Examples:**
  - Monthly active users
  - Days between orders
  - Total orders per year
  - Weekend orders

### 📂 Joins
- Worked on **INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN, SELF JOIN**.
- Solved real-world scenarios combining multiple tables.
- **Examples:**
  - Customers who placed orders
  - Customers who did NOT place any orders
  - Departments without employees
  - Category with highest number of orders
  - Employees with department names
  - Total salary per department

### 📂 Subquery
- Solved queries using **subqueries, correlated subqueries, and nested queries**.

  - Orders with more than average amount

### 📂 Views
